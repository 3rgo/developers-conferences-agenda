# Developers Conferences Agenda/List

This repository list a maximum of conferences's date in order to help conferences organizers.

As a conference organizer, we always ask us what will be the perfect date for the event?

A data to take in account is the date of others events, but how to find this?

And as a developer, a technical lover, we want to have a calendar, we want to know when will be the next event.

I propose to you this github repository in order to list all conferences for developers in france, europe and world.

You want to contribute, add an event or your event? Perfect! Just do a PR in order to update this developers conferences agenda.
If everybody contribute to this repo, it can really help conferences organizer and another goal of this idea is to list a maximum of conferences for developers.
If they don't know your conference they can't buy a ticket and come to it üòè.
